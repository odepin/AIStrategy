Key Challenges
■Many organizations spend a lot of time, money and political equity trying to define an artificial
intelligence (AI) strategy instead of focusing on business problems.
■When it comes to AI, the first question many CIOs, and even line of business (LOB) leaders, ask
is: “Which platform should I use?” But starting with the technology is like “putting the cart
before the horse.”
■When implementing AI techniques, AI skills and a proper set of data (linked to practical use
cases) should be front and center, but many organizations only make these second-order
considerations.
■Organizational issues are important for the sustainability of AI efforts, but they are often
promoted at the expense of a rigorous business use case selection process.

Recommendations
CIOs looking to apply AI in the enterprise should:
■Invest only in the most impactful, measurable business use cases that are achievable in a
limited time frame.
■Hire the right analytics, IT and business skills necessary for those business use cases.■Assign data stewards to select, secure and prepare the appropriate data linked to the selected
use cases.
■Choose the most suitable AI techniques for the problem to be solved, along with the right tools
aligned with the selected skills.
■Build an AI expertise organizational structure designed for knowledge transfer and problem
solving
